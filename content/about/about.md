Blending sounds from Southeast Asia and contemporary indie-pop, Koleh creates a unique dreamy sound in his music.

**Dave Ruby Howe (Triple J)**:

"*I'm keen on this one. Really exciting to hear some fresh sounds and bask in the overall imaginative spirit you've conjured here Koleh*."

## Kenyah Dayak Heritage

A large amount of Koleh's sound is owed to his [Kenyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenyah_people) Dayak heritage, and the [Sampe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapeh), a lute instrument played by the [Dayak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayak_people) people of Borneo.
Living in Australia, Koleh's music provides a way for him to stay connected to Kenyah culture, as well as a vehicle for personal expression.

Koleh's mum, Jinap Ato, strung together traditional bead artwork for both his singles; **Temengang** and **Maze**.
